## Privacy Policy

The privacy of my visitors is extremely important. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used.

First and foremost, I will never share your email address or any other personal information with anyone without your direct consent.

### GitHub Pages

This site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}. I have no control over what, if any log files they keep. I also have no access to that information myself. At least, none that I'm aware of at the time of writing this.

### Cookies and Web Beacons

When you visit this site “convenience” cookies are stored on your computer when you submit a comment to help you log in faster to [Disqus](http://disqus.com/){:target="_blank"} the next time you leave a comment.

If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your web browser options. Instructions for doing so can be found on the specific web browsers’ websites.

#### Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a web analytics tool I use to help understand how visitors engage with this website. It reports website trends using cookies and web beacons without identifying individual visitors. You can read [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html){:target="_blank"}.

#### Gumroad

I sell plans on this site, through a company called [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/){:target="_blank"}. If you buy any of my plans through Gumroad, you are subject to [Gumroad's privacy policy](https://gumroad.com/privacy){:target="_blank"}.

## Disclosure Policy

I make money on this website through affiliate programs. If you click an affiliate link and buy the product, you help support this website because I’ll get a percentage of that sale.

Currently I’m an affiliate for Amazon.

What this means for you:

* I became an affiliate to earn revenue towards the costs of creating YouTube videos, and maintaining this site.
* I do not and will not recommend a product just for the sake of making money.
* I do not let the compensation I receive influence the content, topics, posts, or opinions expressed on this website, or in my videos.
* I respect and value my viewers/readers too much to share anything other than my own genuine and objective opinions and advice.

Just like this website, my Disclosure Policy is a work in progress.
