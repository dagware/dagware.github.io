My name is Dan Thomas". I'm a retired software engineer, and I get my engineering fix nowadays in the workshop.

I also love editing videos, and I have a whole series of music videos that are really stunning, even if I say so myself.

You can find my music videos at my [other YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/dagware). Watch the channel trailer for an idea of what some of my music videos are like.

And of course you can find my woodworking videos at my [main YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/thenewbiewoodworker).
